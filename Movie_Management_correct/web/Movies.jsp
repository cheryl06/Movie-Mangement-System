                Plot:
Sriram Venkat is the most shallow guy on earth who doesn’t value relationships, family, friends, life or the country. Not necessarily in that order. Because he couldn’t care less about the order. This makes him the clear ‘black’ sheep of the family. At some point this shallow man begins to narrate the story of the crazy relationship he shared with Dia Sharma. His ex girlfriend. A firebrand social activist who wanted to change the world. An attraction which was physical initially but then got emotional and finally veered into complex territories resulting in a clash of ideologies and mindsets which drove them apart. Bitterly. Sriram believed that charity begins and ends at home. Whilst Dia felt that you have to be the change that you want to bring about. However Sriram realizes that he is not over Dia and still loves her and that she is the best change that ever happened… and will happen to his life. But Dia has moved on and is now in an obscure village in Gujarat called Jhumli.
